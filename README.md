## About The Project
An advanced program that allows us to use the capabilites of `AdvantageKit`, a library that allows every input and output to be logged onto a USB device
during runtime in order to look through data or debug issue. This code is still for the main part untested, as out drivetrain for the offseason has not
been constructed yet.

## Installation
Installation is fairly straight forward, since all of the vendoerdeps have been loaded online, there is nothing needed to be downloaded on your end, all
you need to have the latest version of WPILib installed, which as of right now is build `2024.3.2`. Once install, simplify clone the repository as shown:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/ultimatehecker/FRCMinotaurSwerve
```
